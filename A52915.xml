            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Have not been able to omit making known to you thoÅ¿e Å¿ad tidings which lately happened here; namely, that all our fruitful <hi>Northern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (except that of <hi>Keeren</hi> and <hi>Swaagdijke,</hi> and that farther EaÅ¿tward of <hi>Hoorn,</hi> as far as <hi>EnckhuyÅ¿en</hi>) is Å¿o miÅ¿erably overflowed, that it is like a great Pool of Water, which came to paÅ¿s on this wife:</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59745:3"/>
            <p> Upon <hi>Sunday</hi> the third of this InÅ¿tant <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> S. N. the North-weÅ¿t Wind did Å¿o drive in the Sea upon us, that you would have thought that the Waves thereof would have overwhelmed the whole Country; and the Water was d<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
               </gap>ven in Å¿o vehemently by the Storm, that it flowed higher here at this time, than was ever Å¿een by any man living before; for in the Night it was riÅ¿en to that heighth, that it Å¿tood an Inch above the lower Lintel of our High HouÅ¿es, and the Stream can through all our Low HouÅ¿es.</p>
            <p>The next day in the Evening, there was a great floing in of the Water at the Sluce of the <hi>EaÅ¿t-gate;</hi> alÅ¿o it broke through the Dike at the <hi>EaÅ¿t-gate,</hi> where the SpaniÅ¿h Cavalry Å¿tood; Å¿o that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter began to flow exceeding high in that place, but was Å¿topped by the powerful aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of men, that brought with them Sails and Weights for that purpoÅ¿e; alÅ¿o they brought two great Schuyts, and placed them upon the Sails, and filled them full of water, Å¿o that by that means they might bear down the Sails with the greater weight.</p>
            <p>About Two a Clock in the Morning the Bells of the <hi>Brant</hi> and <hi>State-houÅ¿e</hi> began to ring, which occaÅ¿ioned a great Alarm in the City; at that time News was brought, That the Dike to the WeÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of <hi>Hoorne</hi> was broken through between <hi>Scharwoude</hi> and the <hi>Swarte Church;</hi> and about half an hour after there came likewiÅ¿e News that there was another great breach made in the Å¿aid Dyke before <hi>Carbalius Wieltie,</hi> Å¿o that the Burghers came too late thither. But to prevent farther danger, and to turn the water back as much as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59745:3"/>was poÅ¿Å¿ible. The next day in the Morning they beat the Drums, to give notice, That if there were any that would work at the Breaches of the Dykes for Wages, they Å¿hould repair to <hi>Keeren,</hi> where they Å¿hould he civily enterained, (there being already great Companies of Volunteers at work both before and behind the Water, and had brought Earth &amp; Stones thither to make a crooked Ba<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>Somerdyke,</hi> to hinder it from flowing more Northwards; but this proved unÅ¿uccesful, for in the Evening the <hi>Somerdyke</hi> was broken through in two or three places, and had overflowed that good Land as far as <hi>Medenblick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it pleaÅ¿ed God to bleÅ¿s the endeavours of the people at <hi>Keeren,</hi> Å¿o that their work was not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in vain there, for by that crooked Bank which they had made they forced the Water to run over as far as <hi>Swaagdyke;</hi> and being Å¿upplyed with Earth, they made a Dyke by which they could the better Å¿top the Water there, and hinder it from breaking farther into the <hi>Polder,</hi> which hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Å¿ucceeded well, and it is hoped will Å¿o continue, by the bleÅ¿Å¿ing of Almighty God, and the great care and vigilance of our MagiÅ¿trates, who have quitted themÅ¿elves extraordinary well in this Affair.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Dear Friend,</hi> This day being <hi>WedneÅ¿day,</hi> I went to the great Church with my Father, (which was the firÅ¿t time of my going forth Å¿ince <hi>Monday<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59745:4"/>The Sermon being ended, we alÅ¿o went all of us thither, and found all things in the dreadfulleÅ¿t condition that can poÅ¿Å¿ibly be expreÅ¿t with a Pen; For they tell us, that Å¿ome of the poor Boars were come thither with their Goods in Schuijts: That others had filled their Schuijts with drowned Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, &amp; brought them thither to Å¿ell, (they being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to eat the drowned BeaÅ¿ts or Å¿tarve.)

AlÅ¿o they Å¿ay, that others are fled with their Wives and Children, having loÅ¿t all their Cattel, and whatÅ¿oever they had beÅ¿ides. In general, the Calamity is Å¿o great, it cannot be expreÅ¿t by any perÅ¿on alive.</p>
            <p>The 7th InÅ¿tant in the Morning (the Bells having rung, and the Drums beat all the night) all the men came to <hi>Keeren</hi> to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t in Å¿topping the Water.</p>
            <p>It is now alÅ¿o commanded by the <hi>States,</hi> that all the Women Å¿hould come forth (that are able to work) to help the men to lade Stones in Ships, that they might be carried and Å¿unk before the Breach: The Women in all parts of the Country are Å¿o for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in complying with this Command, that they paÅ¿s by here in ThouÅ¿ands towards <hi>Luydendijke</hi> having their Baskets with them to carry Stones; Å¿o that it is with us (you may think) as if we were in a Beleaguered City, the which is dreadfull to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.
